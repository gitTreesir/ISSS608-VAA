<h1>1. Overview</h1>
<p>City of Engagement, with a total population of 50,000, is a small city located at Country of Nowhere. The city serves as a service centre of an agriculture region surrounding the city. The main agriculture of the region is fruit farms and vineyards. The local council of the city is in the process of preparing the Local Plan 2023. A sample survey of 1000 representative residents had been conducted to collect data related to their household demographic and spending patterns, among other things. The city aims to use the data to assist with their major community revitalization efforts, including how to allocate a very large city renewal grant they have recently received.</p>
<section id="the-task" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-task">1.1. The Task</h2>
<p>In this Take-Home Exercise, we will reveal the demographic and financial characteristics of the city of Engagement by using appropriate static and interactive statistical graphics methods, to help the city managers and planners to explore the complex data in an engaging way and reveal hidden patterns.</p>
</section>
<section id="data-source" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-source">1.2. Data Source</h2>
<p>Two (2) datasets will be used, as inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Participants.csv</strong> – information about the residents of City of Engagement who agreed to participate in this study.</li>
<li><strong>FinancialJournal.csv</strong> – information about the financial transactions of the participants from March 2022 to February 2023.</li>
</ul>

<section id="loading-of-required-r-packages" class="level1">
<h1>2. Loading of Required R Packages</h1>
<p>The required R library packages are being loaded. For this exercise, we will make use of the following R library packages.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>tidyverse</strong>, a family of modern R packages specially designed to support data science, analysis and communication task including creating static statistical graphs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>plotly</strong>, R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>gganimate</strong>, an ggplot extension for creating animated statistical graphs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ggiraph</strong> for making ‘ggplot’ graphics interactive.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ggdist</strong> for visualizing distributions and uncertainty.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ggstatsplot</strong> for creating graphics with details from statistical tests</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ggridges</strong>, a ggplot2 extension specially designed for plotting ridgeline plots</p></li>
<li><p><strong>viridis</strong> allows you to generate color palettes based on the viridis scheme</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ggrepel</strong> provides geoms for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text labels</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ggpubr</strong> provides a convenient interface for creating publication-ready plots using the ggplot2 package</p></li>
<li><p><strong>extrafont</strong> makes it easier to use fonts other than the basic PostScript fonts that R uses.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The code chunk below uses <code>pacman::p_load()</code> to check if the above packages are installed. If they are, they will be loaded into the R environment.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>participantId</strong> is in <code>&lt;dbl&gt;</code> format. Since this is used to identify each participant uniquely, we will convert it to a <code>string factor</code></li>
<li><strong>educationLevel</strong> is in <code>&lt;chr&gt;</code> format. We will convert it to a <code>string factor</code></li>
<li><strong>householdSize</strong> is in <code>&lt;dbl&gt;</code> format. We will convert it to <code>&lt;int&gt;</code> format since it should be a whole number.</li>
<li><strong>haveKids</strong> is in <code>&lt;lgl&gt;</code> format and has value of <code>TRUE</code> and <code>FALSE</code>, which are not very intuitive. We will change it to <code>YES</code> and <code>NO</code> instead.</li>
<li><strong>age</strong> is in <code>&lt;dbl&gt;</code> format. We will convert it to <code>&lt;int&gt;</code> format since it should be a whole number.</li>
<li>We will also bin the <code>age</code> and <code>joviality</code> for analysis purposes.</li>

<p><strong>Design Consideration</strong> Ridgeline plot is a set of overlapped density plots, which could help us compare distributions of the dataset. They are useful for visualizing changes in distributions over time. As such, we will make use of such plots to present 3 sets of information for the period of study (i.e.&nbsp;Mar 2022 to Feb 2023).</p>

<p><u><strong>Explanation</strong></u></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>There was no significant difference in the spending across the different education levels.</li>
<li>The Representative Residents generally spent &lt;$3000 per month.</li>
<li>It was observed that there was a sharp increase of expenditure across all education levels in the month of March and could reach as high as $8000.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="analysis-of-monthly-income-and-spending">4.1.4. Analysis of Monthly Income and Spending</h3>
<p><strong>Design Consideration</strong> We use an interactive scatterplot to analyse the monthly income with the spending of the representative residents on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>For the graph below, the x-axis represents the monthly income, while the y-axis shows the monthly expense as a percentage (over the monthly income). The label ticks of y-axis was intentionally left to exceed 100% (anything over 100% will imply that the resident overspent for that particular month. Different colours of the bubbles are used to represent the different education levels. Additional information such as the Age, Household Size and whether the resident has kids will also be shown when the user mouseover the points.</p>

<p><u><strong>Explanation</strong></u> The above violin plot shows that 247 representative residents with kids tend to spend more (approximately $2450) compared to the remaining 633 without kids.</p>
<p>Since the p-value is very small (less than the significance level of 0.05), we can reject the null hypothesis that having kids will result in higher expenditure and conclude that there is a significant difference between the means of the two samples.</p>
<p>However, we also noted that <span class="math inline">\(\hat{r}\)</span> value of -0.38 would indicate a moderate negative correlation between the two samples. This suggests that there may be a relationship between the samples, such that as one sample increases, the other sample decreases.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="one-way-anova-test">4.3 One-Way ANOVA Test</h2>
<p>One-Way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) test is used to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between the means of three or more independent groups. The purpose of conducting a One-Way ANOVA test is to determine whether the variation in the response variable (dependent variable) is due to the variation in the factor being tested (independent variable) or whether it is simply due to chance.</p>
<p>We will conduct a One-Way ANOVA test on the Total Expenditures (dependent variable) with different levels of education (independent variable).</p>

<p><u><strong>Explanation</strong></u> A p-value of 0.03 means that there is a 3% probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme or more extreme than the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. This suggests that there is some evidence against the null hypothesis and that the observed differences in means between the groups may be statistically significant. It is also observed that the median values are slightly different across the different education levels.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="correlation-tests">4.4. Correlation Tests</h2>
<p>Correlation tests are performed to investigate the strength and direction of a relationship between two variables. It helps to determine if the variables are related and, if so, how strongly they are related. As such, we will conduct 2 correlation tests here. The first correlation test will look at the relationship between Total Income and Total Savings; the second correlation test will examine the relationship between Age and Wages.</p>
