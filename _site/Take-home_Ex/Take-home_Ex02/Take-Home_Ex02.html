<h1>1. Overview</h1>
<p>With reference to the <a href="#0">Mini-Challenge 2</a> of <a href="#0">VAST Challenge 2023</a> and by using appropriate <strong>static and interactive statistical graphics</strong> methods, we will help FishEye identify companies that may be engaged in illegal fishing.</p>
<section id="the-task" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-task">1.1. The Task</h2>
<p>Use visual analytics to identify temporal patterns for individual entities and between entities in the knowledge graph FishEye created from trade records. Categorize the types of business relationship patterns you find.</p>
</section>
<section id="data-source" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-source">1.2. Data Source</h2>
<p>For this task, we will make use of the <em>mc2_challenge_graph.json</em> provided for the data analysis and visualisation.</p>

<h1>2. Loading and Launching of Required R Packages</h1>
<p>The required R library packages are being loaded. For this exercise, we will make use of the following R library packages.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>jsonlite</strong>, JSON parser and generator optimized for statistical data and the web.</li>
<li><strong>tidygraph</strong> provides a tidy framework for all things relational (networks/graphs, trees, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>ggraph</strong>, an extension of the ggplot2 API tailored to graph visualizations and provides the same flexible approach to building up plots layer by layer.</li>
<li><strong>visNetwork</strong> for network visualization.</li>
<li><strong>lubridate</strong> is an R package that makes it easier to work with dates and times.</li>
<li><strong>igraph</strong> a library collection for creating and manipulating graphs and analyzing networks.</li>
<li><strong>tidyverse</strong>, a family of modern R packages specially designed to support data science, analysis and communication task including creating static statistical graphs.</li>

<p>From the network graph below, each node represents an individual business entity (<code>label</code>), which you could select from the dropdown list, to examine the connectivity of this entity with other entities.</p>
<p>In order to prevent the network graph from overcluttering, all edges with weight &lt;= 50 will not be displayed.</p>
<p>For the ease of selecting a particular entity, the dropdown list has been sorted in ascending order by using <code>arrange()</code>.</p>
<p>In addition, directional arrows have also been included on the edges, to help identify the nodes that are highly connected to other nodes in the network.</p>
<p>Hover action is also enabled for the graph so that the user can hover the mouse pointer over the graph to look at the possible different ‘groups’ of connectivity.</p>

<p>From the above network graph, we noticed that some of the nodes in the middle cluster seemed to be denser compared to the rest, indicating that these nodes probably have more connections to the other nodes. With the help of the hover function, we were able to identify the ids of these nodes. However, it requires the user to maneuver around the graph with great efforts.</p>
<p>We will make use of the different centrality indices (Centrality, Betweenness Centrality, Closeness Centrality, Degree Centrality, In-Degree and Out-Degree Centrality) to aid in identifying the key nodes of the network in the subsequent sections.</p>

<p>We will attempt to identify the nodes with high centrality index, that would most likely be the main hubs within the network.</p>
<p>Firstly, we will take a look at the distribution of the centrality index across all the nodes to gain an overview picture of the network.</p>
<p>In view that there are some extrememly low count figure, the <code>count</code> for each bin is displayed at the top of each bar for ease of reference.</p>

<p>The graph above revealed that there are <strong>3</strong> nodes that have a centrality index &gt; 0.5. This means that these nodes are well-connected to other nodes in the network. These nodes have very high number of in-degree centrality index, indicating that they are most likely to be the fishery wharves/central collection centers.</p>

<p>Based on the DataTable and network graph, these 3 entities are likely to be the primary fishery wharves/collection centers within the network, as they have high in-degree centrality indices. However,the low out-degree centrality index, betweenness centrality index and closeness centrality index suggested that these nodes have limited impact/reach within the network.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="looking-at-the-degree-of-centrality">4.3. Looking at the Degree of Centrality</h2>
<p>Degree centrality is a measure of the importance or popularity of a node in a network based on the number of connections it has. It quantifies how many direct connections a node has with other nodes in the network.</p>
<p>Nodes with high degree centrality have many connections or interactions with other nodes. They are often considered as influential or popular within the network since they have a wide reach and can easily communicate or spread information to other nodes. On the other hand, nodes with low degree centrality have fewer connections and may have limited influence or reach within the network.</p>
<p>In simpler terms, degree centrality captures how well-connected or popular a node is in a network. It reflects the number of direct connections a node has and provides insights into its potential influence, access to information, or ability to transmit messages to other nodes.</p>

<p>In-degree centrality is a measure of centrality in a network that focuses on incoming connections to a node. In simple terms, it quantifies how popular or influential a node is based on the number of incoming connections it receives from other nodes in the network.</p>
<p>Nodes with high in-degree centrality are often considered influential or important within the network. They have a larger number of connections pointing towards them, indicating that they receive a lot of attention, information, or resources from other nodes. In social networks, individuals with high in-degree centrality may be seen as popular or well-connected, as they have a large number of friends.</p>
<p>In-degree centrality is particularly useful when studying networks where the focus is on nodes receiving information, resources, or influence from others. It helps identify key individuals or nodes that are central to the flow of information or interactions within the network.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="looking-at-the-out-degree-centrality">4.5. Looking at the Out-Degree Centrality</h2>
<p>Out-degree centrality is a measure of centrality in a network that focuses on outgoing connections from a node. In simple terms, it quantifies how much influence or impact a node has on other nodes in the network based on the number of outgoing connections it has.</p>
<p>Nodes with high out-degree centrality are often seen as influential or important within the network. They have a larger number of connections pointing away from them, indicating that they have a greater reach and influence over other nodes. In social networks, individuals with high out-degree centrality may be considered as opinion leaders or trendsetters, as they have a significant impact on the behavior and choices of others.</p>
<p>Out-degree centrality is particularly useful when studying networks where the focus is on nodes influencing or affecting other nodes. It helps identify key individuals or nodes that have a strong impact on the network as they possess many connections that reach other nodes.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="eigenvector-centrality">4.6. Eigenvector Centrality</h2>
<p>Eigenvector centrality is a measure to indicate the importance or influence of a node to the other nodes. It considers both the number of connections a node has and the importance of those connections. Nodes with high eigen centrality are not only connected to many other nodes but are also connected to nodes that have high eigen centrality.</p>
