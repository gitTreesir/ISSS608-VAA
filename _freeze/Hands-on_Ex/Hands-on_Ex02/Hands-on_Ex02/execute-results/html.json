Getting Started\n\n### 1.1. Install and launch R packages\n\nIn this exercise, beside tidyverse, four R packages will be used. They are:\n\n-   ggrepel: an R package provides geoms for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text labels.\n-   ggthemes: an R package provides some extra themes, geoms, and scales for 'ggplot2'.\n-   hrbrthemes: an R package provides typography-centric themes and theme components for ggplot2.\n-   patchwork: an R package for preparing composite figure created using ggplot2.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, ggrepel, patchwork, ggthemes, hrbrthemes)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### 1.2. Importing the data\n\nIt consists of year end examination grades of a cohort of primary 3 students from a local school. It is in csv file format.\n\nThere are a total of seven attributes in the exam_data tibble data frame. Four of them are categorical data type and the other three are in continuous data type.\n\n-   The categorical attributes are: ID, CLASS, GENDER and RACE.\n-   The continuous attributes are: MATHS, ENGLISH and SCIENCE.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nexam_data <- read_csv(\"data/Exam_data.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## 2. Beyond ggplot2 Annotation: ggrepel\n\nOne of the challenge in plotting statistical graph is annotation, especially with large number of data points.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method=lm, \n              linewidth=0.5) +  \n  geom_label(aes(label = ID), \n             hjust = .5, vjust = -.5) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### 2.1. Working with ggrepel\n\nggrepel is an extension of ggplot2 package which provides geoms for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text as in the above example.\n\nTo do so, we simply replace geom_text() by geom_text_repel() and geom_label() by geom_label_repel.\n\nNote: We will get the warning message: \"ggrepel: 318 unlabeled data points (too many overlaps). Consider increasing max.overlaps\" when we run the code snippet. However, in order to eliminate the warning message, we will need to set max.overlaps=Inf. This, however, makes the entire chart cluttered with labels (which seemed worse that the original chart above, without using ggrepel).\n\nAlternatively, we can just set warning=FALSE to suppress the warning message and let ggrepel does its work of suggesting the 'best' number of labels.\n\nTo show the comparison, the left tab code snippet will present the warning message, while the right tab code snippet will show the chart is cluttered with labels when we set max.overlaps=Inf.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Original Codes (without setting max.overlaps=Inf)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method=lm, \n              linewidth=0.5) +  \n  geom_label_repel(aes(label = ID), \n                   fontface = \"bold\") +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Revised Codes (with max.overlaps=Inf)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method=lm, \n              linewidth=0.5) +  \n  geom_label_repel(aes(label = ID), \n                   fontface = \"bold\", max.overlaps=Inf) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## 3. Beyond ggplot2 Themes\n\nggplot2 comes with eight built-in themes, they are: theme_gray(), theme_bw(), theme_classic(), theme_dark(), theme_light(), theme_linedraw(), theme_minimal(), and theme_void().\n\nRefer to this [link](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/#themes) to learn more about ggplot2 Themes\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"grey25\", \n                 fill=\"grey90\") +\n  theme_gray() +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Maths scores\") \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### 3.1. Working with ggtheme package\n\nggthemes provides 'ggplot2' themes that replicate the look of plots by Edward Tufte, Stephen Few, Fivethirtyeight, The Economist, 'Stata', 'Excel', and The Wall Street Journal, among others.\n\nIn the example below, The Economist theme is used.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"grey25\", \n                 fill=\"grey90\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Maths scores\") +\n  theme_economist()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt also provides some extra geoms and scales for 'ggplot2'.

Working with hrbthemes package\n\n[hrbrthemes](https://cinc.rud.is/web/packages/hrbrthemes/) package provides a base theme that focuses on typographic elements, including where various labels are placed as well as the fonts that are used.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#pacman::p_load(extrafont)\n#font_import()\n#loadfonts(device = \"win\")\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"grey25\", \n                 fill=\"grey90\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Maths scores\") +\n  theme_ipsum()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe second goal centers around productivity for a production workflow. In fact, this \"production workflow\" is the context for where the elements of hrbrthemes should be used. Consult this [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hrbrthemes/vignettes/why_hrbrthemes.html) to learn more.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"grey25\", \n                 fill=\"grey90\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Maths scores\") +\n  theme_ipsum(axis_title_size = 18,\n              base_size = 15,\n              grid = \"Y\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom the example above, we learnt that\n\n-   axis_title_size argument is used to increase the font size of the axis title to 18\n-   base_size argument is used to increase the default axis label to 15, and\n-   grid argument is used to remove the x-axis grid lines.\n\n## 4. Beyond Single Graph\n\nIt is not unusual that multiple graphs are required to tell a compelling visual story. There are several ggplot2 extensions provide functions to compose figure with multiple graphs. In this section, we will create composite plot by combining multiple graphs. First, let us create three statistical graphics by using the code chunk below.\n\nFirstly, the histogram for MATHS scores\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n p1 <- ggplot(data=exam_data,\n             aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"grey25\", \n                 fill=\"grey90\") + \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Maths scores\")\n\np1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNext, the histogram for ENGLISH scores\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\np2 <- ggplot(data=exam_data,\n             aes(x = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"grey25\", \n                 fill=\"grey90\") +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of English scores\")\n\np2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLastly, we will draw a scatterplot for English score versus Maths score by as shown below\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\np3 <- ggplot(data=exam_data,\n             aes(x= MATHS, \n                 y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method=lm, \n              linewidth=0.5) +  \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3\")\n\np3\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### 4.1. Creating Composite Graphics: pathwork methods\n\nThere are several ggplot2 extension's functions support the needs to prepare composite figure by combining several graphs such as grid.arrange() of gridExtra package and plot_grid() of cowplot package.\n\nIn this section, We will use a ggplot2 extension called patchwork which is specially designed for combining separate ggplot2 graphs into a single figure.\n\nPatchwork package has a very simple syntax where we can create layouts super easily. Here's the general syntax that combines:\n\n-   Two-Column Layout using the Plus Sign +.\n-   Parenthesis () to create a subplot group.\n-   Two-Row Layout using the Division Sign /\n\n### 4.2. Combining 2 ggplot2 graphs\n\nFigure below shows a composite of two histograms created using patchwork. Note how simple the syntax used to create the plot!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\np1 + p2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### 4.3. Combining 3 ggplot2 graphs\n\nWe can plot more complex composite by using appropriate operators. For example, the composite figure below is plotted by using:\n\n-   \"\\|\" operator to stack two ggplot2 graphs,\n-   \"/\" operator to place the plots beside each other,\n-   \"()\" operator the define the sequence of the plotting.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(p1 / p2) | p3\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo learn more about, refer to [Plot Assembly](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/articles/guides/assembly.html).\n\n### 4.4. Creating a composite figure with tag\n\nIn order to identify subplots in text, patchwork also provides auto-tagging capabilities as shown in the figure below. For tagging,\n\n-   '1' for Arabic numerals,\n-   'A' for uppercase Latin letters,\n-   'a' for lowercase Latin letters,\n-   'I' for uppercase Roman numerals, and\n-   'i' for lowercase Roman numerals.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n((p1 / p2) | p3) + \n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### 4.5. Creating figure with insert\n\nBeside providing functions to place plots next to each other based on the provided layout. With inset_element() of patchwork, we can place one or several plots or graphic elements freely on top or below another plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\np12 <- p1|p2\np3 + inset_element(p2, \n                   left = 0.02, \n                   bottom = 0.7, \n                   right = 0.5, \n                   top = 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### 4.6. Creating a composite figure by using patchwork and ggtheme\n\nFigure below is created by combining patchwork and theme_economist() of ggthemes package discussed earlier.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npatchwork <- (p1 / p2) | p3\npatchwork & theme_economist()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
